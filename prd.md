### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: Empty Legs Flight Platform
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

The Empty Legs Flight Platform is a comprehensive marketplace that connects private jet charter companies with customers seeking cost-effective luxury travel through empty leg flights. Empty leg flights occur when private jets need to reposition for their next charter, creating opportunities for significant savings while maintaining premium travel experiences.

This platform serves as a three-sided marketplace featuring charter companies who can list and manage their empty leg inventory, customers who can search and book these flights at reduced rates, and administrators who oversee the ecosystem. The solution includes web and mobile applications with real-time booking capabilities, dynamic pricing, and comprehensive management tools.

The platform addresses the inefficiency in private aviation where aircraft often fly empty between charters, providing a win-win solution for both operators looking to generate revenue from otherwise empty flights and travelers seeking luxury travel at accessible prices.
